This is a series of post I am starting as an outreach activity, in the context of my PhD research program, [EpiTRAITS](http://www.epitraits.eu/).

In these posts, I will try to explain some engineering and modeling approaches - not necessarily closely linked to my actual work for EpiTRAITS - that can be useful in real life.
